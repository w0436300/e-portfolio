# PROG 5010 - Final Project

##  e-Portfolio Update & Revamp

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  

- Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the assignment.  
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

### Tasks:  

#### NSCC ePortfolio

As part of being a “portfolio college”, NSCC requires all students to produce a portfolio before graduation. A portfolio can come in many forms depending on the student that creates it. Students in the Full Stack Application Development Diploma program are strongly encouraged to develop an electronic portfolio or “e-portfolio”. An e-portfolio is simply a website that allows anyone to view the student’s portfolio of information from the Internet. Your task is to **continue to work on and significantly update** this website, which you first created at the end of our WEBD 5000 course.

### Objective:

To enhance your existing ePortfolio by integrating advanced front-end development techniques learned in the course,  thereby moving more towards having an ePortfolio that is an **impressive demonstration of your skills to show to potential employers** in the Winter term.

### Project Components:

1.  **Planning and Structure**:
    
    -   **Requirement Gathering:** Students should identify areas for improvement in their existing ePortfolio.
   
2.  **Advanced Front-End Implementation:**
   Include **multiple** of the following:
    
    -   **Integration of Vue.js:** Refactor the existing ePortfolio to incorporate Vue.js components for better interactivity and reactivity.
    -   **Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation:** Implement additional features using Vanilla JS for dynamic content rendering and interaction.
    -   **API Integration:** Retrieve data from a public API (e.g., GitHub, Unsplash, Weather API, etc.) and display it dynamically within the portfolio.
    -   **SASS/CSS or Bootstrap/Tailwind Implementation:** Improve styling and layout using advanced CSS techniques or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
    
3.  **Content Enhancement**:
    
    -   **Recent Course Work Samples:** Include and showcase work samples from the most recent courses within the portfolio.
    -   **Media Integration:** Embed multimedia elements such as videos or interactive graphics to showcase projects or achievements.
    
4.  **Testing and Optimization**:
    
    -   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensure the updated portfolio works well across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
    -   **Responsiveness:** Make the ePortfolio mobile-friendly and ensure it is responsive across various devices.
    -   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the codebase and assets to ensure faster loading times.
    
5.  **Documentation and Presentation**:
    
    -   **Documentation:** Students are encouraged to document the process of implementing advanced techniques and solving challenges.
    -   **Final Presentation:** Students should present their updated ePortfolios, highlighting the added features and improvements made in a pre-recorded video following the video submission checklist, as mentioned below.



## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you navigating your completed Website in the **browser** (e.g. Chrome) and viewing your **code** in the text editor (e.g. VS Code within your GitHub Codespace) to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Final Project Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AUDIO OR SPEAK DURING THE VIDEO. HOWEVER, IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO, THEN YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST AS THERE WILL BE NO AUDIO TO TELL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING IN A GIVEN STEP.
